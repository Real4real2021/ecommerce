**Abstract:**

The agricultural sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by increasing consumer demand for fresh, locally sourced produce and a growing interest in sustainable farming practices. E-commerce platforms are emerging as a powerful tool to connect farmers and producers directly with consumers, bypassing traditional supply chains and creating new opportunities for growth.
